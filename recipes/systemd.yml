  # Note: Container compose services are now created dynamically as user services
  # by the homelab-setup tool during the deployment step. This follows best practices
  # for rootless containers by running services under the user's systemd instance
  # instead of as system services.
  #
  # Services are located in: ~/.config/systemd/user/
  # Manage them with: sudo -u <user> systemctl --user <command> <service>
  #
  # Example:
  #   sudo -u dockeruser systemctl --user status podman-compose-media.service
  #   sudo -u dockeruser systemctl --user restart podman-compose-web.service
